    <!-- Create a grid of white squares, any dimensions.  When you click on a single square it will turn red, when you click on it again it will turn green, then blue, then red, cycling through the colors.

    Start recording these actions as soon as the page loads, and make a replay and reset button for the actions.  The reset button also resets the recording time.  Since this is very abstract, you can make any program using performance.now() and event listeners. -->
